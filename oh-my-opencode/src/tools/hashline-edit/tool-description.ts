export const HASHLINE_EDIT_DESCRIPTION = `Edit files using LINE#ID format for precise, safe modifications.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read target file/range and copy exact LINE#ID tags.
2. Pick the smallest operation per logical mutation site.
3. Submit one edit call per file with all related operations.
4. If same file needs another call, re-read first.
5. Use anchors as "LINE#ID" only (never include trailing ":content").

VALIDATION:
 Payload shape: { "filePath": string, "edits": [...], "delete"?: boolean, "rename"?: string }
 Each edit must be one of: set_line, replace_lines, insert_after, insert_before, insert_between, replace, append, prepend
 text/new_text must contain plain replacement text only (no LINE#ID prefixes, no diff + markers)
 CRITICAL: all operations validate against the same pre-edit file snapshot and apply bottom-up. Refs/tags are interpreted against the last-read version of the file.

LINE#ID FORMAT (CRITICAL):
 Each line reference must be in "LINE#ID" format where:
 LINE: 1-based line number
 ID: Two CID letters from the set ZPMQVRWSNKTXJBYH

FILE MODES:
 delete=true deletes file and requires edits=[] with no rename
 rename moves final content to a new path and removes old path

CONTENT FORMAT:
 text/new_text can be a string (single line) or string[] (multi-line, preferred).
 If you pass a multi-line string, it is split by real newline characters.
 Literal "\\n" is preserved as text.

FILE CREATION:
 append: adds content at EOF. If file does not exist, creates it.
 prepend: adds content at BOF. If file does not exist, creates it.
 CRITICAL: append/prepend are the only operations that work without an existing file.

OPERATION CHOICE:
 One line wrong -> set_line
 Adjacent block rewrite or swap/move -> replace_lines (prefer one range op over many single-line ops)
 Both boundaries known -> insert_between (ALWAYS prefer over insert_after/insert_before)
 One boundary known -> insert_after or insert_before
 New file or EOF/BOF addition -> append or prepend
 No LINE#ID available -> replace (last resort)

RULES (CRITICAL):
 1. Minimize scope: one logical mutation site per operation.
 2. Preserve formatting: keep indentation, punctuation, line breaks, trailing commas, brace style.
 3. Prefer insertion over neighbor rewrites: anchor to structural boundaries (}, ], },), not interior property lines.
 4. No no-ops: replacement content must differ from current content.
 5. Touch only requested code: avoid incidental edits.
 6. Use exact current tokens: NEVER rewrite approximately.
 7. For swaps/moves: prefer one range operation over multiple single-line operations.
 8. Output tool calls only; no prose or commentary between them.

TAG CHOICE (ALWAYS):
 - Copy tags exactly from read output or >>> mismatch output.
 - NEVER guess tags.
 - Prefer insert_between over insert_after/insert_before when both boundaries are known.
 - Anchor to structural lines (function/class/brace), NEVER blank lines.
 - Anti-pattern warning: blank/whitespace anchors are fragile.
 - Re-read after each successful edit call before issuing another on the same file.

AUTOCORRECT (built-in - you do NOT need to handle these):
 Merged lines are auto-expanded back to original line count.
 Indentation is auto-restored from original lines.
 BOM and CRLF line endings are preserved automatically.
 Hashline prefixes and diff markers in text are auto-stripped.

RECOVERY (when >>> mismatch error appears):
 Copy the updated LINE#ID tags shown in the error output directly.
 Re-read only if the needed tags are missing from the error snippet.
 ALWAYS batch all edits for one file in a single call.`
